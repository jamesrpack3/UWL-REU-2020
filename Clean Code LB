## Data Cleaning

In the beginning, we worked to clean the data. I then saved it as a separate csv file in order to easily access it. 

```{r loading data, echo=FALSE}
phyto_9606 <- read_csv('Phytos_1996-2006.csv')
phyto_0812 <- read_csv('Phytos_2008-2012.csv')
phyto_info <- read_csv('Phyto_info_WQdata.csv')

# Combining data from all the time periods
phyto_all <-phyto_9606 %>% bind_rows(phyto_0812)

# Combine data with site information
phyto<- phyto_all %>% left_join(phyto_info, by= "SHEETBAR")

# Clean the data, by changing the Date from a character to number
phyto$DATE <-phyto$DATE %>%  mdy() 

#3134 rows, 45 columns
write.csv(phyto,'Phyto_All Data.csv')

phyto <- read_csv('Phyto_All Data.csv')

#I added a separate column for th year and made the biovolume metric smaller
phyto_data<- mutate(phyto,year = year(DATE), month = month(DATE),) %>% 
  rename(BIOMASS='TOTAL BV_um3L') %>% mutate(BIOVOLUME=BIOMASS*.0000001) 
```

#Phytoplankton Communities

We viewed trends in diversity using biovolume for abundance. There were six divisions of phytoplankton observed withing the UMR. This was calculated using percentage of biovolume of each division. 

Over time
  -Communities are over 75% concentrated by diatoms in orange and cyanobacteria in pink.
  -There is a decrease in biodiversity over time, diatoms compose over 60% of the spiece composition, and other divisions seem to dwindle. 
  
Field Station
  -Diversity is higher in the upper stations
  -Cyanobacteria is mainly present in the upper stations with over 15% specie composition, and only 5% in the lower stations. 
  -Diatoms compose over 85% in the lower stations. 

```{r Composition of Biovolume}
#Filtering out to show the summer months, to be consistant will all of the data
phyto_bio <- phyto_data %>% filter(1996<=year&year<=2012,month==7|month==8)
# A simple color pallet that takes into account color blindness
cbp2 <- c("#E69F00", "#000000", "#0072B2", "#F0E442","#999999","#CC79A7")

#Composition of Biovolume over time
phyto_bio %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill=factor(DIVISION,levels=c("Bacillariophyta","Pyrrophyta", "Chlorophyta", "Chrysophyta", "Cryptophyta","Euglenophyta", "Cyanobacteria")), y=BIOVOLUME, x=year))+
  geom_bar(position='fill', stat='identity')+ xlab("Year")+ ylab("Percentage of Biovolume")+ 
  theme(legend.title="Division")+   scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1996,2012,2))+
  theme_bw(base_size=20)+scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent_format()) + 
  ggtitle("Composition of Biovolume Over Time (%)")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = cbp2) + labs(fill="Division")

#Composition of Biovolume by field station
phyto_bio %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill=factor(DIVISION,levels=c("Bacillariophyta","Pyrrophyta", "Chlorophyta", "Chrysophyta", "Cryptophyta","Euglenophyta", "Cyanobacteria")), y=BIOVOLUME, x=FLDNUM))+
  geom_bar(position='fill', stat='identity')+ xlab("Field Station")+ labs(fill="Division") +
  ylab("Percentage of Biovolume")+ theme(legend.title="Division")+ theme_bw(base_size=20)+  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,6,1))+scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent_format()) + 
  ggtitle("Composition of Biovolume by Field Station (%)") +scale_fill_manual(values = cbp2)
```

Qualitative Approach____
We continue to look at phytoplankton communities by using Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) of species community

We used NMDS to contrast the specie composition across different field stations. Ordination plots arrange points so that the distance correlates to the similarity between samples

The points are fairly scattered across the plot, but the lighter orange to yellow colors tend towards the left side of the plot which represents the upper stations. 

```{r NMDS}
#Data file containing a table of field stations on the left and the six Divisions on the horizontal
ord<-read_csv('FLDvDivision.csv')
#remove the FLDNUM, so only the Divisions are shown
ord_comm<-ord[2:7] 

#Checking the best dimension for this analysis based on the stress value
dimcheckMDS(ord_comm) #we chose k=2 dimensions
stressplot(phyto_ord.mds) #Displays that k=2 fits the data very well. R^2 = 0.981

#Perform the NMDS function sing a bray curtis distance
phyto_ord.mds <- metaMDS(comm = ord_comm, distance = "bray", trace = FALSE, autotransform = FALSE, k=2)
#We remove the NA Values
MDS_xy <- data.frame(phyto_ord.mds$points) %>% na.omit()
MDS_xy$FLDNUM<-ord$FLDNUM
phyto_ord.mds$FLDNUM<-ord$FLDNUM
#Making the FLDNUM a vector so we can customize the color pallet
Field_Stations <- factor(MDS_xy$FLDNUM)
cbp2 <- c("Orange", "Goldenrod", "Yellow", "Blue","Violet","Navy")

#Plotting the NMDS
MDS_xy %>% 
   ggplot(aes(MDS1,MDS2))+ xlab("Distance in Space")+ylab("Distance in Space")+ 
   geom_jitter(aes(color=Field_Stations), size=5)+theme_bw(base_size=20) +
   scale_color_manual(values=cbp2) +ggtitle("Spatial Community by Division")

```

Quantitative Approach___

We used Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) to quantify the contrast in specie composition. 

The significance value, P, is very low P= 0.001, meaning the field stations are significantly different. However, the R value is also very low R=0.11, indicating that the field stations are a very small factor in affecting specie composition. 

```{r ANOSIM}
#Using the same data in the NMDS, we take the ANSIM of the data
ano<-anosim(ord[2:7], ord$FLDNUM, distance="bray")
#This provides the statistics R and P, and the dissimilarity mareix
summary(ano)
#Another colorblind friendly pallet
cbp3 <- c("Dark Green","#E69F00", "#000000", "#0072B2", "#F0E442","#999999","#CC79A7")
#plotting the ANOSIM using field stations
plot(ano,xlab="Field Stations",ylab="Dissimilarity Rank Value", col=cbp3)
```
